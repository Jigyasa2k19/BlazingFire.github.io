#### Sloka Recitation
Bhagavad Gita was spoken directly by the supreme counsellor and psychologist none other than Lord Sri Krishna. The therapeutic effects of traditional shloka recitation are not unknown to our ancestors. If one recites and reflects on the Gita regularly and attentively, he will gain access to newer and higher truths of life through which he can lead a lively yet thoughtful and balanced life. If a person just hears Bhagavad Gita at the fag end of his life, he gets freed from all lamentations and anxieties arisen from debacles committed in his life. Then what to speak of a person who regularly chants it â€¦. 

Participate in this one-of-a-kind recitation event to embalm your life with the Gita.
