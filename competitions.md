**Drama-** The art of dramatics has been an integral part of our culture going far back. We have a rich tradition of transmitting our great histories such as Ramayana and Mahabharata and other epic stories via the medium of drama. This year in Jigyasa, we are providing a platform for you to display your talents and also continue this tradition by enacting a drama based on our epics.

**Solo Vocals-** The one who sings knows no boundaries but only the joy of expression - the joy that follows a song felt from the heart and sung from the soul. And nothing is more beautiful, and nothing then is more appealing. And surely, nothing is more satisfying than singing your heart out loud.

**Short Movie Making-** *"You shouldn't dream your film, you should make it!"* - Steven Spielberg . Movies allow us to enter other minds, not simply in the sense of identifying with the characters, but by seeing the world as another person sees it.  Do you often find yourself immersed in this world?  Have you ever wondered what would it feel like if this was not only your passion but also your profession?  Jigyasa aims to provide you with the first stepping stone.

**Sloka Recitation-** Bhagavad Gita was spoken directly by the supreme counsellor and psychologist none other than Lord Sri Krishna. The therapeutic effects of traditional shloka recitation are not unknown to our ancestors. If one recites and reflects on the Gita regularly and attentively, he will gain access to newer and higher truths of life through which he can lead a lively yet thoughtful and balanced life. If a person just hears Bhagavad Gita at the fag end of his life, he gets freed from all lamentations and anxieties arisen from debacles committed in his life. Then what to speak of a person who regularly chants it
